# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Does not meet expectations**

I can't find any documentation (readme, planning folder, ERDs, wireframes, etc).

That said, I do appreciate your pretty clean commit history / meaningful messages,
good job there.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

I'm pleased that you not only met the requirements with 2 models, associations,
but that you also got authorization working with CanCanCan. Good job.

You probably feel this as well, but I would like to see you keep progressing so
you can add in additional models, such as your 'digs' model. Happy to pair with
you on that at some point next week.


## Creativity / Interface

**Meet expectations**

I like the simplicity/minimalism of your design, but I'd prefer to see you do
more of this yourself, instead of relying on bootstrap. Given your design, you
could probably achieve the same look (or very close) in about 40 lines hand-written
CSS.

It's important to know how to use frameworks like bootstrap, but it's also
important to show employers that you can write CSS by hand.


## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

To be honest, there's not a whole lot of code for me to evaluate, but in general
your code is neat, well formatted, and well-named. I made some in-line comments
with more details / suggestions for improvement, and happy to pair next week
on them if you have any questions.


## Deployment and Functionality

**Does not meet expectations**

This was **really** close, but because there were a few major issues (such as
crashing when logged out and trying to view the main page), I can't quite mark
this as meets expectations. You have a good baseline of an app to build on
though. I honestly think that together we could fix the crashing issue and add
digs in under an hour.
